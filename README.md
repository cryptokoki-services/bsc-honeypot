### BSC Honeypot Token

The BSC Honeypot Token is a BEP20 smart contract designed to create a honeypot token on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering native support for PancakeSwap. With a feature-rich design, this honeypot contract provides greater flexibility and control over token liquidity and trading, making it an ideal solution for those looking to create a honeypot BSC token.

### 🚨 Key Features of Honeypot BSC Contract

- 🍯 **Switchable Honeypot**
    
    This BSC honeypot token includes a switchable function that restricts sales. By default, the token behaves like any normal BEP20 token. When the honeypot is activated, sales are blocked for everyone except whitelisted accounts. Non-whitelisted holders will have their funds locked in the liquidity pool, securing them until you withdraw. This allows you to create a BSC honeypot token that can be toggled for flexibility.
    
- 🎭 **Hidden Owner**
    
    You can renounce ownership of the token to increase credibility, while still retaining full control through the hidden owner functionality. This lets you manage the honeypot activation, whitelisting, and other key aspects of your token without appearing as the token's owner on-chain.
    
- 📄 **Whitelist Functionality**
    
    The whitelist feature gives you fine-grained control over the token's liquidity and chart appearance. Only whitelisted accounts can sell during honeypot activation, allowing you to manage price and liquidity with precision. This is useful for ensuring a more organic look on platforms like DexTools or DexScreener when launching your honeypot BSC token.
    
- 💈 **Open Trading on PancakeSwap**
    
    Deploy your honeypot BSC token in advance and choose when to allow trading. The Open Trading function allows you to set a future launch date and make the token available on PancakeSwap, instantly listing it on popular tracking tools like DexTools and DexScreener.
    
- 💱 **Advanced Tax System**
    
    Configure buy and sell taxes for your token with flexibility. Initially, the taxes can be set high, and they can automatically lower after a set number of transactions to boost trading activity. The tax system also ensures that the collected fees are converted to BNB, allowing you to generate actual returns from token trades on the BSC network.
